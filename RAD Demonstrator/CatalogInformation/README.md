# RAD Demonstrator

This package is designed to help users get started with Relational Anomaly Detection (RAD). It includes all the components needed to follow the "Working with Relational Anomaly Detection" tutorial, available in the DataMiner documentation. You can find the tutorial at docs.dataminer.services by navigating to DATAMINER TUTORIALS ? DATAMINER ANALYTICS ? Working With Relational Anomaly Detection. The package is also featured in the 2025 Empower replay video on Relational Anomaly Detection.

The package consists of 4 elements that represent DAB transmitters (with dummy data). After deployment,
the elements
can be found in Cube under the DataMiner Catalog -> Using Relational Anomaly Detection view and are named:
- RAD - Commtia LON 1
- RAD - Commtia LON 2
- RAD - Commtia LON 3
- RAD - Commtia STH 1

The package also contains an automation script that you can use as a basis
for doing more advanced rad configurations using the RAD API.
